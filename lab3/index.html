	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>For this lab, we created indexex within our computers for both our homepages and lab 3.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Because I took 251 last semester, most of this stuff was just review. I showed Jeremy how to do a few things and brushed
			up on a few skills myself. I somehow got confused on what screenshots to post put here, but I think I got it. I don't know
		  why my images won't scale down, it's normally a simple process but it's not working.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are the screenshots:</p>
